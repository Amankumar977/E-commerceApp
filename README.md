# Peopely- A full stack MERN Project

This is a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) project featuring full responsiveness and dynamic elements like a real-time admin dashboard and chat functionality using Socket. IO.

For the front end, I utilized React along with Redux Toolkit for efficient state management. The design is enhanced with Tailwind CSS and Material UI, ensuring a modern and polished appearance. Real-time admin dashboard charts are powered by React Apex Chart and ECharts, providing insightful data visualization.

On the backend, Node.js and Express.js form the foundation, while JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Bcrypt bolster security and authentication. Nodemailer facilitates seamless email communication.

The real-time chat feature is implemented using the WebSocket library Socket.IO, ensuring smooth and instantaneous communication between users.
